# Image-classifier-using-CNN
 Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.
 
 
 #MODEL
 The image-classifier developed here is a CAT-DOG Image classifier with a 87% accuracy
 

#ARCHITECTURE
A CNN consists of a number of convolutional and subsampling layers optionally followed by fully connected layers. The input to a convolutional layer is a m x m x r image where m is the height and width of the image and r is the number of channels, e.g. an RGB image has r=3. The convolutional layer will have kfilters (or kernels) of size n x n x q where n is smaller than the dimension of the image and q can either be the same as the number of channels r or smaller and may vary for each kernel. The size of the filters gives rise to the locally connected structure which are each convolved with the image to produce k feature maps of size mâˆ’n+1.

Each map is then subsampled typically with mean or max pooling over p x p contiguous regions where p ranges between 2 for small images (e.g. MNIST) and is usually not more than 5 for larger inputs. Either before or after the subsampling layer an additive bias and sigmoidal nonlinearity is applied to each feature map. The figure below illustrates a full layer in a CNN consisting of convolutional and subsampling sublayers. Units of the same color have tied weights.
